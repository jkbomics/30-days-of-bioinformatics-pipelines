# 🚀 30 Days of Bioinformatics Pipelines

Welcome to my **30-day learning challenge** on building and automating **bioinformatics pipelines**!  
This series is focused on hands-on practice with tools like **Nextflow, WDL, Snakemake, Docker, AWS, HPC, R, and Python** – aligned with industry requirements for NGS and multiomics workflows.

Each day, I’ll publish a small project/script in this repository, documenting my progress in mastering **pipeline engineering, workflow automation, and data analysis** for genomics.

---

## 📅 Daily Progress

- **[Day 1: Bash script to run FastQC](./Day1_FastQC_Bash/)**  
  A simple Bash script to run FastQC on FASTQ files inside a folder and save reports into a results directory.  

- Day 2: *(coming soon... Python script to parse FastQC results into a summary table)*  
- Day 3: *(coming soon... R script for PCA plot of gene expression data)*  
- Day 4: *(coming soon... Volcano plot generator in R)*  
- Day 5: *(coming soon... File renaming automation with Bash/Python)*  
- … and more up to **Day 30** 🚀

## 🎯 Goals of This Challenge
- Gain **hands-on experience** with workflow managers (Nextflow, WDL, Snakemake, CWL).  
- Learn to **containerize bioinformatics pipelines** with Docker & Singularity.  
- Practice **CI/CD for bioinformatics** with GitHub Actions.  
- Explore **AWS and HPC integration** for scalable NGS analysis.  
- Strengthen **Python, R, and Shell scripting** for genomics workflows.

## 🧰 Skills Being Practiced
- Workflow automation (Nextflow, Snakemake, WDL)  
- NGS pipelines (RNA-Seq, WGS, Metagenomics)  
- Docker & containerization  
- Cloud (AWS) & HPC environments  
- GitHub version control & CI/CD  
- R (DESeq2, edgeR, ggplot2, survival) and Python (pandas, matplotlib)

## 📌 Note
This repo is primarily for **learning and practice**. Large FASTQ datasets are **not included** here.  
Instead, instructions or links are provided in each day’s README to download small **test datasets** when required.
